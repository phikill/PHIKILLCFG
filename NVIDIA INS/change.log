- added function to restore all p-states to its bios defaults on 258+ drivers (right click the "apply clocks" button)

- added general bit value editor for unknown settings (right click the setting item)
  [available after setting scan in advanced setting mode] 

- added "CUSTOM SETTING NAMES" (CSN) feature via localized xml file for overide nvidia driver api setting names to user defined ones
